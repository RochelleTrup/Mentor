                    <h5>PROFESSIONAL PROFILE</h5>
                    <p>I am an accomplished senior finance professional.  I started my career in capital markets in both US and UK Investment banks, latterly co-founding several businesses; building out operational teams, raising both seed and venture funding and following through to exits.  
                        I gained broad international commercial experience in the technology industry spanning Europe, the UAE and Asia Pacific, with a record of delivering growth at the leading edge of B2B Saas platforms. I’m a strategic leader with a focus on building strong relationships with customers and stakeholders and developing effective and resilient teams. I have experience on both sides of M&A transactions in the proptech space and in managing growth, change and cross-cultural integration.  
                        Currently, I hold 2 NED roles and serve as a mentor for 3 female founders. Beyond my professional endeavours, I am dedicated to giving back, 
                        I served as a trustee for a women's refuge for 8 years, volunteered at a soup kitchen, and I have collaborated with several mentoring organizations.
                        I am interested in step change growth so looking for NED roles in growth, tech and real estate.
