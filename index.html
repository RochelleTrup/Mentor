                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>For two decades, I've entwined my business and personal lives,
                    coming to recognize that leading a company as a woman adds layers of complexity and nuance. Beyond the demands of the enterprise,
                    I've navigated the roles of a mother and wife. It isn't just about business success; it's about personal transformation amidst the multiple hats we, as women, wear.
                    These unique challenges prompted me to reflect annually, evaluating my choices and setting goals for the year ahead.</p>

                    and business demands. We didn't merely converse; we probed, challenged, and unearthed insights about our intertwined roles.</p>
