            <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>Balancing my personal life with my professional commitments has always been a challenging endeavor. </p>
            <p>There have been countless moments when significant events and <br> priorities could slip through the cracks.</p>

            <p>Two decades ago, I committed to a transformative practice: an annual reflection on the year gone by<br> and the changes I aspired to make in the coming year.</p>

            <h2>MY APPROACH</h2>
                <p>For 20 years, a friend and I established a ritual where annually, we'd <br> dedicate two days to discuss work-life balance questions.</p>

                <p>Through this, we held each other accountable, challenging and mentoring  <br> each other through our answers.</p>

                <p>The strength of this ritual lay not only in the questions but in our mutual accountability. <br> Being challenged and scrutinized promoted real introspection and growth.</p>

            <h2>PERSPECTIVE</h2>
            <p>From my experience as a founder with C-suite roles, I've felt the tension between <br>professional demands and personal well-being. </p>
            <p>A mentor, holding you accountable in both business and personal aspects, is invaluable. </p>
            <p>They not only broaden your viewpoint but also help pinpoint areas for change, be it professional,<br> personal, or both for the coming year.</p>

            <p>I aim not just for a program, but to establish a foundation supporting entrepreneurs from underprivileged backgrounds.</p> 
            <p>After benefiting from this initiative, I hope you'll become a mentor, offering invaluable insights to other entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p>I foresee a managed impact investment fund, helping entrepreneurs grow and flourish.</p>
