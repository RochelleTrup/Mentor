            <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>Balancing my personal life with my professional commitments has always been a challenging endeavor. </p>
            <p>As a woman, there were countless moments when significant events and <br> priorities seemed to slip through the cracks.</p>

            <p>Two decades ago, I committed to a transformative practice: an annual reflection on the year gone by<br> and the changes I aspired to make in the coming year.</p>

            <h2>MY APPROACH</h2>
                <p>For 20 years, a friend and I established a ritual where annually, we'd <br> dedicate two days to discuss work-life balance questions.</p>

                <p>Through this, we held each other accountable, challenging and mentoring  <br> each other through our answers.</p>

                <p>The strength of this ritual lay not only in the questions but in our mutual accountability. <br> Being challenged and scrutinized promoted real introspection and growth.</p>

            <h2>PERSPECTIVE</h2>
            <p>From my experience as a female founder and in C-suite roles, I've felt the tension between <br>professional demands and personal well-being. </p>
            <p>A mentor, holding you accountable in both business and personal aspects, is invaluable. </p>
            <p>They not only broaden your viewpoint but also help pinpoint areas for change, be it professional,<br> personal, or both for the upcoming year.</p>

            <h2>MY ASPIRATIONS</h2>
            <p>Participation in this initiative is free. Under "My Aspirations", I aim not just for a program, but to establish a foundation <br> supporting female entrepreneurs from underprivileged UK backgrounds.</p> 
            <p>After benefiting from this initiative, I hope you'll mentor, offering invaluable insights to these women. <br>Your guidance can greatly influence their success.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I foresee a mentee-managed investment fund, helping woman entrepreneurs grow and flourish.</p>
            <p>Looking forward, women-led corporations are partnering with us, with sponsorships bolstering our <br> capacity to aid budding entrepreneurs.</p>

            <h2>COMMIT TO TRANSFORMATION</h2>
                <p>Over the course of four sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, we will delve deeply into these topics.</p>
                <p>This is not just a reflection; it's a commitment to work.</p>
                <p>Together, we will pinpoint the one or two essential changes you aspire to make for the upcoming year.<br> This dedicated process is an annual pledge to change.</p>
