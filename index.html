                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>Balancing my personal life with my professional commitments has always been a challenging endeavor.
                    There have been countless moments when significant events and priorities could slip through the cracks.
                    Two decades ago, I committed to a transformative practice: an annual reflection on the year gone by
                    and the changes I aspired to make in the coming year.</p>

                    <h2>My Approach</h2>
                    <p>A friend and I established a ritual where annually, we'd dedicate two
                    days to discuss work-life balance questions.
                    Through this, we held each other accountable, challenging and mentoring each other through our answers.
                    The strength of this ritual lay not only in the questions but in our mutual accountability. Being challenged
                    and scrutinized promoted real introspection and growth.</p>

                <div class="section" >
                    <h2>Perspective</h2>
                    <p>From my experience as a founder with C-suite roles, I've felt the tension between professional
                    demands and personal well-being.
                    A mentor, holding you accountable in both business and personal life, is invaluable.
                    They not only broaden your viewpoint but also help pinpoint areas for change, be it professionally,
                    and personallly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="section" >
                    <h2>My Aspiration</h2>
                    <p>To establish a foundation supporting entrepreneurs from underprivileged backgrounds.
                    After benefiting from this initiative, I hope you'll become a mentor, offering invaluable insights to other entrepreneurs.
                    I foresee a managed impact investment fund, helping entrepreneurs grow and flourish.</p>

                <div class="section" >
                    <h2>Commit to transformation</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of four sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, we will delve deeply into the questions, list goals and detail key results.
                    This is not just a reflection; it's a commitment to work.</p>
                    <p>Together, we will validate,confirm rules and summarise goals.
                        This dedicated process is an annual pledge to evolve.</p>
