                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>For three decades, I've entwined my business and personal lives,
                    coming to recognize that leading a company as a woman adds layers of complexity and nuance. It isn't just about business success; 
                    it's about personal transformation amidst the multiple hats we, as women, wear.
                    I have learnt to understand my passions, values together with limitations and with that knowledge I have been been able to play to my strengths.

                <h2>Our Reflective Journey</h2>
                <p>Each year, a close friend and I set aside two days for profound introspection.
                We explore the challenges of balancing personal relationships with professional demands. 
                we engage in rigorous debates, challenging each other to uncover insights into our business and personal decisions, how each affects the other, and the changes we needed to make.
                These unique challenges prompted me to reflect annually, evaluating my choices and setting goals for the year ahead.</p>

                <h2>Perspective</h2>
                <p>Leading a business isn't just about strategizing and executing. For women, it often intertwines with our roles as mothers, partners, caregivers, and more.
                    This journey is uniquely yours, I bring to the table my experience of navigating this intricate dance. Whether you're facing a business challenge,
                    a relationship hurdle, or the delicate balance of both, I'm here to question and help you find clarity and direction whilst helping 
                    establish your goals and the yardsticks by which these goals can be measured.</p>
